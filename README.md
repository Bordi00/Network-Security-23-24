## Types of attacks
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack [1](#references) is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.
There are two main types of DoS attacks:

- Bandwidth-based (volumetric): attacks which aim to consume the bandwidth of the target (e.g.: ICMP flood, HTTP flood, DNS amplification, etc.) 
- Resource-based: attacks which aim to consume all the target resources such as buffer, memory, cpu execution cap. In this type are divide into:
  - Application Layer: these attacks target vulnerabilities in the application layer of a system. Instead of overwhelming the network with traffic, they exploit the applicationâ€™s weaknesses to consume server resources or cause it to crash (e.g. Slowloris, HTTP Slow Post)
  - Protocol exploitation: these attacks exploit flaws in the network protocols to overload the target (e.g.: ping of death, SYN flood)

## Network Layer DoS attacks
The network layer provides the means of transferring variable-length network packets from a source to a destination host via one or more networks. This layer responds to service request from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer. We will analyze the IP protocols and how this non secure protocol can be exploited by a malicious user.

### IP recap
During this lab we will use IPv4 since its the most used at the moment. This protocol is described in RFC 791 and the year after it became the standard of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). The header consists of 14 fields, of which 13 are required.
<inserire immagine ip header>
The total length of the entire packet size including header and data is 65535 bytes and the minimum size is 20 bytes (header without data). Some of the fields important to us are: fragment offset (since the message can be split in different ip packets), protocol (it can be set to ICMP, TCP, UDP and others) and lastly source and destination address.

### Ping Flood 
Ping flood is a volume based attack where we try to take the hole bandwidth for our self by spamming pings to the victim, this will render the server unreachable to any one else. To do so we will use the hping3 command but first we need to set up the environment.

#### GNS3
GNS3 is a Graphical Network Simulator created in python and under the GPL license. To start it open a terminal type gns3 and press enter
